## CODING
Unfortunately, I wasn't smart enough at the time to actually save the source code so all that I have left is the finished game (I wasn't THAT dumb, so I did have the file on Drive).

Mainly I build: 
```
- Scoring and momentum based Multiplier system
- Swinging and Collision Physics 
- Randomly generated placement of cubes and Rarity System 
- Endless Mode and Optimization of Resources so that the cubes Despawn When Off Screen 
- Particle System and Postprocessing 
```

## WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT
1.  Basic Unity and Game Dev knowledge
2.  C# understanding and familiarization
3.  Low level Game Physics knowledge
